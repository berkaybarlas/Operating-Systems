# Project 3 

### We implemented all parts of the project.

What are the inode values of file1.txt and file2.txt? Are they the same or different? Do the two files have the same—or different— contents?

Next, edit file2.txt and change its contents. After you have done so, examine the contents of file1.txt . Are the contents of file1.txt and file2.txt the same or different?

rm file1.txt
Does file2.txt still exist as well?

Are the inodes the same, or is each unique? Next, edit the contents of file4.txt. Have the contents of file3.txt been altered as well? Last, delete file3.txt. After you have done so, explain what happens when you attempt to edit file4.txt.

### The project can be test with following command  
``` 
make run 
```
